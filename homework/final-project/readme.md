# Wanderlust

1. Why are you making this project? What is your motivation?
  - I chose to create Wanderlust, my creative coding final, with the intent of creating a type of travel diary, allowing me to reminisce on my past travel experiences. I have never been one for journaling or writing in a diary, but I have recently begun to wish I have. There are so many moments and experiences about my past travel experiences that I do not want to forget, and this is my solution to combatting memory loss. 
2.What are your inputs?
  - The inputs for this project include the photos of passports, representing my own personal passport. Another main input would be my coded html website "Wanderlust," which displays all the information about each trip, which is shown when each stamp is clicked on.
3.What are your outputs?
  - The outputs for Wanderlust is an interactive experience, where users can click through different travel experiences. The information available will be places visited, food eaten, and favorite experiences. These will all be accessible with clickable buttons and hitzones.  
4.Who is the target audience for your project?
  - The target audience for Wanderlust is mostly for my own personal use, however it can also be useful for people looking to gain insights into what it is like to travel to Costa Rica, Morocco, Italy and Spain.
5.Where will your project be displayed?
  - Wanderlust will be displayed online, specifically on my personal website in the portfolio section. This will allow me to give potential employers a look at my different skills, while also showing more of my personality and interests.
